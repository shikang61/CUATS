# CUATS_Challenge

Team name: Wolves of Wall Street 


Challenge statement:
Starting with a cash balance of **$100,000**, develop a trading algorithm that achieves a **positive alpha** with the **highest Sharpe ratio (minimum of 1.00)**, the **maximum profit**, and a **maximum drawdown of 20%**.  The trading strategy should be **backtestable over any 7 year period from 1 January 1980** to the present and benchmarked against the **S&P 500 Index**.  You may use any tradable instrument across all assets of the **US markets** available on QuantConnect in constructing your trading strategy.  (Strategies that use Crypto assets will be benchmarked against Bitcoin)

Note: A template code will be provided on the CUATS GitHub including the default QuantConnect standard execution model and fees structure as well as maximum leverage limit of 10 -  similar to what has been used in our example strategies from the CUATS Coding Sessions.
